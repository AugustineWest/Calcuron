      <h1><span>About Calcuron</span></h1>
      <p>
        Calcuron is a quiet little corner of the internet built by one person who loves numbers, hates clutter,
        and got tired of fighting through pop-ups just to run a simple calculation.
        Every tool on this site runs directly in your browser — no accounts, no saved data, no background tracking.
        Just fast, focused utilities that answer real questions.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Calcuron Started</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for Calcuron didn’t come from a business plan or a branding workshop. It came from something
        much simpler: frustration.
      
        Late one night, while trying to quickly compare two loan offers on a phone with spotty reception,
        I opened a “popular” calculator site. The page loaded slowly, jumped around as ads appeared,
        opened a full-screen overlay, and then demanded cookies and consent before I could even type a number.
        By the time I got my answer, I could have done the math on paper.
      
        That experience stuck with me. Over the next few weeks I kept noticing the same pattern:
        mortgage calculators covered in banners, fitness tools wrapped in trackers, simple converters buried
        in endless menus. The tools themselves weren’t bad — they were just buried under everything else.
       
        Calcuron began as a small personal project: “What if there was a site that did the opposite?
        No distractions. No logins. Just tools.” One prototype calculator turned into a handful,
        then into a full library of utilities and simulation engines.
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Calcuron Is</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, Calcuron is a growing library of online calculators, converters, and simulators designed
        around three simple ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast</strong> — Tools should load quickly, respond instantly, and feel smooth on modern devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Private</strong> — Your inputs stay in your browser. Calcuron doesn’t ask who you are or what you’re calculating.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical</strong> — Every tool should solve a real problem, not just exist for the sake of having more pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some tools are straightforward — like age calculators, unit converters, or simple loan estimators.
        Others go deeper, like financial projection simulators, mortgage risk models, and fitness/physique planners.
        The goal is the same in every case: keep the interface clean, highlight the result,
        and make the underlying assumptions as transparent as possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who Calcuron Is For</h2>
      <p>
        Calcuron is built for people who just want to get an answer and move on with their day:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> checking GPA impact, loan terms, or time-zone conversions before a deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>Home buyers & renters</strong> comparing payments, interest, and long-term affordability.</li>
        <li><strong>Investors & planners</strong> exploring “what if” scenarios with savings, withdrawals, and risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Health & fitness enthusiasts</strong> estimating calories, macros, and body-composition trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Everyday problem-solvers</strong> who need quick conversions, percentages, and basic math tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You don’t need an account. You don’t need to remember a password. You don’t even need to stay on the page
        after you get your answer. Calcuron is here when you need it and invisible when you don’t.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How the Tools Are Built</h2>
      <p>
        Behind each calculator is a mix of standard formulas, documented assumptions, and a lot of testing.
        I try to keep every tool:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparent</strong> — whenever possible, the math and assumptions are described in plain language.</li>
        <li><strong>Conservative</strong> — financial and forecasting tools are designed for education, not promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-contained</strong> — tools run entirely in your browser using JavaScript, without sending inputs to a server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many tools began because I needed them personally: comparing payoff strategies, modeling savings,
        estimating travel costs, or experimenting with long-term projections.
        If a calculator or tool here isn’t something I would use myself, it won’t make the cut.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Privacy First, By Design</h2>
      <p>
        The internet doesn’t need another site asking for your email before showing you a result.
        Calcuron’s privacy philosophy is intentionally simple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calcuron does <strong>not</strong> collect personal information.</li>
        <li>Calcuron does <strong>not</strong> save your inputs or results to a database.</li>
        <li>Calcuron does <strong>not</strong> require accounts, logins, or sign-ups.</li>
        <li>Calcuron avoids custom tracking cookies and fingerprinting scripts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Everything runs client-side — meaning <strong>your data never leaves your device while you’re using the tools.</strong>
        If you refresh the page, your entries disappear. That’s intentional.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Where Calcuron Is Going</h2>
      <p>
        Calcuron is still a work in progress and always will be. Over time, the plan is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add more deep-dive simulation tools for long-term planning and “what-if” experiments.</li>
        <li>Refine existing calculators with clearer explanations, examples, and visualizations.</li>
        <li>Expand into niche areas that are under-served by typical calculator sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        New tools are built gradually and tested with real-world scenarios before being added to the site.
        The goal isn’t to have the most calculators on the internet — it’s to have a collection that people
        actually trust and come back to.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve found Calcuron useful, thank you for being part of its early story.
        This project started as a late-night experiment and has grown into a full toolkit,
        one page at a time.
